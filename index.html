<p>I'm Olga, a Cyber Security Engineer.</p>

<p>This is my personal site where I share what I learn as I grow in the security field, among other things that I am interested in and believe contribute to my professional growth.</p>

<p>Overall, this site will capture <a href="/posts">posts</a> about #incident_analysis, #malware, #code, #ctf, #learning, #listening, and my endless obsession with #organization.</p>
