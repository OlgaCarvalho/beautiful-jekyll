2022 was filled with many ups and downs 📈📉.

Both in a personal context and in a professional context, this year was challenging, which is to say the least. 

In my personal life, I have had many wins, but also some of the biggest losses I ever had.

This, of course, impacted my professional output, which is **OK** - we're human...  ⬅️ this was the hardest lesson that I had to learn.

As such, I took time to focus on my life, family and loved ones.

However, any small win is important to celebrate, so for my professional highs we have:

* Launched my new website (this one)
* Was lead for the first time on a forensic investigation (CL0P ransomware 🏴‍☠️)
* Did my first CTF in cyber defense
* My article "*CIIA: Critical Infrastructure Impact Assessment*" was published on the Symposium on Applied Computing (SAP)
* Changed jobs to a brand new field - Threat Hunting
* Studied and defined a Threat Hunting and Threat Intelligence procedure to be implemented in my organization
* Participated in a Talent Bootcamp at my *alma mater* - such a rewarding experience
* Created my first threat advisory - CVE-2022-42889
* Attended [BSides Lisbon](https://bsideslisbon.org/) 2022 where I connected with amazing security specialists

And this is it, happy new year!
