If you enjoy automating your workflows, a Slack bot might be just what you need.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is an instant messaging program especially used by organizations, but in this case we will create a Slack channel just for our own use.

On the other hand, a Slack bot is essentially a type of Slack App designed to interact with users via conversation.

The three main kinds of bots we can make are:
* **Reply bots** that respond when someone uses a specific word or phrase.
* **Notification bots** that send updates according to your defined triggers.
* **Slash command bots** that run when a specific command is issued.

In this post I will outline how to make a quick and simple **slash command** bot that will greet us upon the command `\hello` ðŸ¤—



## What we need

* Slack account
* Ngrok reverse proxy that will front our local web service (not secure, only use for local development and testing purposes!)
* Python to develop our app
*  `slack_bolt` Python package to interact with Slack's API



## Tutorial

### Step 1. Create a Slack App

To get started, create a new Slack App on [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com): click on the button **Create an app**.

Then select the **name** you want to give the app (for instance, "HelloWorld") and the **workspace** where you want to build the app on. Make sure you already have one workspace in your Slack channel.

Click on **Create App**.

#### Set Permissions

In order for our bot to be able to do things like read or post messages, we have first to give it permission to do so.

On the left pane, navigate to **OAuth & Permissions**.

![image-20221109110116879](/assets/img/image-20221109110116879.png)


Then scroll down to **Scopes \| Bot Token Scopes** and click on **Add an OAuth Scope**.

For now let's use:

* `chat:write` - Send messages as HelloWorld
* `commands` - Add shortcuts and/or slash commands that people can use



Also, to be able to interact with the bot, navigate to **App Home** on the left pane. Scroll down and under **Messages** make sure you have activated the following line:

![image-20221113210755280](/assets/img/image-20221113210755280.png)



#### Install the app

Scroll up to the top of **OAuth & Permissions** page and click on **Install to Workspace** under **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace**.

Finally, we will have a **Bot User OAuth Token** in the format `xoxb-****-****-****`, that will be used to communicate with Slack's Platform.



### Step 2. Run ngrok

First you need to download *ngrok* from its official website.

This is a command line application, so you need to open a terminal and run `ngrok.exe http 3000`(I am doing this in Windows).

Once it's opened, you'll see a screen like the one below.

![ngrok](/assets/img/ngrok.png)

The field `Forwarding` gives information about the public address that Slack will use to send our app events.



### Step 3. Create a slash command

Let's now create a simple command with which we will be able to greet our bot.

On [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) on the left pane, navigate to **Slash Commands** and **Create New Command** with the following settings:

* Command: `/hello`
* Request URL: `<ngrok-URL-above.ngrok.io*>/slack/events`
* Short Description: Greet our bot!

Then **Save** changes using the button on the bottom right.


*\*`ngrok-URL-above` is the URL on the `Forwarding` field on the previous image.* 

### Step 4. Develop the app

With everything set, let's develop our bot!

First, install the Bolt python package.

```powershell
pip install slack_bolt
```

What you will need:

* `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - this is the token we saw [previously](#install-the-app).
* `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` - this token can be found in [Slack API](https://api.slack.com). Navigate to **Settings \| Basic Information** on the left pane of the app and under **App Credentials** copy your **Signing Secret**.
* Make sure you have your *ngrok* running. See [step 2](#step-2.-Run-ngrok).



Then create a file named `bot.py` and use the following code. Make sure you read the comments and understand what is happening.

```python
import os
from slack_bolt import App

def init_app(port):
    # Save your Bot token and Signing secret as environment variables
    os.environ["SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"] = "xoxb-****-****"  	# your Bot token
    os.environ["SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET"] = "*******" 	# your Signing Secret token 

    # Check if the environment variabled were correctly set
    if os.environ.get('SLACK_BOT_TOKEN', -1) == -1 or os.environ.get('SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET', -1) == -1:
        print("Something went wrong setting the environment variables")
        exit()

    # Initialize the app with your tokens
    app = App(
        token=os.environ.get("SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"),
        signing_secret=os.environ.get("SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET")
    )

    # Listen for the command "/hello"
    @app.command("/hello")
    def hello_command(ack, body, say):
        ack()
        user_id = body["user_id"]
        say(f"Hi <@{user_id}>!")

    # Start a simple HTTP server on the port given
    app.start(port=port)
   
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # First, make sure you have run "./ngrok http 3000" on another terminal
    ngrok_port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 3000)) 
    init_app(ngrok_port)
```

Save your changes.

### Step 5. Run the bot

Execute the app:

```powershell
python .\bot.py
```

You will have a response like so:

> Bolt app is running! (development server)



Go back to your Slack Channel and go to your app.

![image-20221113220950373](/assets/img/image-20221113220950373.png)

Go to **Messages** tab.

![image-20221113221030417](/assets/img/image-20221113221030417.png)

Write the `/hello` command.

And voilÃ¡!

## Next steps

Hopefully this guide got you started with Slack and its powerful automations that might allow you to quickly optimize your workflows.

At this point there's a few things we can do:

* Try listening for events, instead of commands. [Here](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-python#develop) is a good tutorial.

* Use a connection protocol more secure: using [Socket Mode](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket) to communicate with your app without the necessity of exposing a public HTTP request URL.

In the future I will share how I am going to use Slack apps to gather Threat Intel, stay tuned ðŸ˜Š
