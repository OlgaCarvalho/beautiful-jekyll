As an avid note-taker, I need to keep my notes organized and accessible from multiple devices in order to be in touch with all my research, experiments and other projects.


As a long time user of [Typora](https://typora.io/ "https://typora.io/") (I started using it in early beta version and promptly bought the app when it was released), my requisites are high regarding Markdown usability. Unfortunately, they do not have a webapp/syncing feature available.

  
In the beginning, I used GoogleDrive to have my notes and access them between my devices where I would install the drive and Typora. This worked fine until I starting working.

As a cyber security professional, I know the dangers of having personal cloud drives installed on your corporate computer, so I was left using GoogleDrive's webapp, which is _horrible_ to edit/view Markdown files.

  

As such, I had to start looking for the perfect note-taking syncing experience, where the must-have requisites are:

- Webapp (preferably, to avoid restrictive app-locker scenarios) or app with syncing feature
    
- Free or Lifetime license
    
- In-line live Preview/Rendering of Markdown (no split editor please)
    
- Notes must have an outline (table of content) quickly accessible (no infinite scrolls up and down trying to find information)
    
- File manager (folders or notes hierarchy)
    
- Dark Theme
    
- Copy/paste as Markdown
    

  

A quick tip: look into [https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/](https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/) to see applications that support Markdown.

  

_Disclaimer:_ some of these apps I did not install and fully interact with. If the apps' landing page and a quick YouTube video showed me that one or more of my must-have features were not available, then I did not installed the app.

  

## 1\. Gitbook

Gitbook was the first one to try. In the first few minutes looked fine, but in the end was not the right fit for me.

**Pros**:

\+ Webapp (no installation needed)

\+ Simple and clean UI

\+ "Quick Find" search works great

**Cons**:

\- Note-taking is not fluid, it is a constant series of content blocks (paragraphs, lists, tables) (like Notion)

\- No shortcuts for common content blocks (e.g, table)

\- No outline for Pages

\- Page hierarchy follows a weird fixed order: Collection > Section > Pages. If you want to have something like "Folder > Notes", you cannot.

\- Too collaboration-oriented: comment boxes appear on every content block; you have to lock a page to see it clean (similar to "publish") and unlock it if you want to edit it; the statement "Page Description (optional)" is always there which is annoying.

\- Table edit is a nightmare

  

## 2\. Obsidian

Next, looking for GitBook alternatives I looked at [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), since I read that already have Live Preview for markdown.

Everything looked perfectly fine, except for the syncing feature:

> $10 per month or $96 per year
    

Noped out really quickly.

  

## 3\. SimpleNote

I then considered [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). I already use it for other type of notes and projects. However it does not render Markdown in-line.

**Pros**:

\+ Free

\+ Webapp

\+ Runs for all the typical OSes (Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, ...)

\+ Tags

**Cons**

\- No in-line live preview of Markdown

  

## 4\. HackMD

**Pros**:

\+ Free unlimited notes

\+ Nice note outline on the left

**Cons**:

\- No in-line live preview of Markdown (with split editor instead)

  

## 5\. Notable

[Notable](https://notable.app/) looked to be a good contestant, but:

**Pros**:

\+ Dark theme

\+ No vendor lock-in: notes are stored in disk

**Cons**:

\- No in-line live preview of Markdown (with split editor instead)

  

## 6\. Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) was one of the last that I looked at.

It looked to have everything I was looking for, until I realized it was self hosted.

  

  

## 7\. UpNote

Feeling a bit hopeless, thinking maybe I need to mount my own server to have something that I like (a bit too much work for note-taking), I heard about [UpNote](https://getupnote.com/) on a comment section on a review for another tool. But finally, I believe I found a winner!

  

**Pros**:

\+ One-time purchase (currently at $24.99) or Free up to 50 notes with basic features  

\+ Quick Access section

\+ Tags

\+ It offers rich text (text colors, subscript, etc). I like to keep my notes clean and consistent so I don't think I'll use it but is a _nice-to-have_

\+ Pin notes

**Cons**:

\- No webapp, installation required. However, it does run in all OSes that I need

\- Tables are only available on Premium so I will not know how well they do until I buy the app

  

  

So I will be using UpNote for the next week and update this post if any other _pro_  or _con_ arise, and if I am going to buy the app.

  

### *Update*

  

I bough the app hours after using it, it is that good!

**Pros**:  

\+ Templates (I was not expecting how useful this feature would be)

\+ Many customization options (theme, line spacing, paragraph spacing, default image size, default code language, and many others)

\+ No need to escape certain characters (like ‘+’ or ‘-’. You use ctrl+z to remove bullet point)

\+ Back/forward commands work to move between notes

  

**Cons**:

\- Table actions are limited (no reorder of rows/collumns) and no shortcuts are available (add/remove row/collumns). Table manipulation is indeed the most significant fault of the app. So if you work a lot with tables, I do not recommend

\- It is not possible to check current heading level (only when creating it)

\- No markdown shortcuts for certain formats (like using `[mylink](https[.]somelink.com)` )

\- Internal links on templates don’t work (they link to original template and not the note created from the template)

\- No live preview of code syntax

\- PDF export doesn't work well with in-note links

  

All in all, it is clearly a good choice and will be a good complement to Typora.
