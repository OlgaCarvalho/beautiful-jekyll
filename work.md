## 📐 Engineer
#### Personal website
[This website](https://olgacarvalho.github.io/) uses Jekyll static code generator leveraging Markdown files.

These are the versions of my websites:
  * **1st version**: on [Github](https://github.com/OlgaCarvalho/first_personal_website) and my step-by-step guide to create it in [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-07-06-setup-your-personal-website.md %}).
  * **2nd version**: this website right here. You can find its source code on [Github](https://github.com/OlgaCarvalho/olgacarvalho.github.io). This uses the amazing (and free) [BeautifulJekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/) template (with some tweaks 😏).

#### Business Impact Assessment (MSc Thesis)
Established security mechanisms, such as antivirus software, log analyzers and intrusion-detection systems, generally focus on low-level events and report them independently.
To help determine whether a cyber-incident has any current or future negative impact on the organization’s monitored network and goals, research in mission impact assessment tries to estimate that impact.
In this context, **BIA (Business Impact Assessment)** was created as a simulation platform, where one is able to simulate business-process impact by a cyber-threat landscape affecting organizational assets.
